## Overview
This document provides a complete audit of all notification types in the MixPitch system, their descriptions, current routing behavior, and recommendations for improvements.

## Current Routing Issues Identified

### üö® **Major Routing Problems**

1. **Payout Notifications Route to Dashboard** - Users get payout notifications but clicking them just goes to dashboard with no context
2. **Contest Notifications Route to Pitch Page** - Contest winners get notifications but are taken to pitch page instead of contest results
3. **Many Notification Types Have No Specific Routing Logic** - Most notification types default to dashboard or pitch page regardless of context

## Recommended Solutions

### **Phase 1: Add Missing Route Logic**
1. **Contest Notifications** - Route to contest results/management pages
2. **Payout Notifications** - Route to earnings/payouts page  
3. **Direct Hire** - Route to direct hire management pages
4. **Client Management** - Route to client project pages

### **Phase 2: Add New Route Parameters**
1. Add contest-specific routing parameters to notification data
2. Add payout-specific routing parameters
3. Add client project routing parameters

### **Phase 3: Handle Edge Cases**
1. Route cancelled/closed pitches to project page instead of potentially 404 pitch page
2. Add fallback routing for missing related objects
