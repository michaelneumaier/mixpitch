### 6.11 Services and Workflow Patterns
----

#### Services
- **Purpose:** Encapsulate complex business logic, transactional operations, and cross-cutting concerns. Services coordinate models, notifications, files, and workflow transitions.
- **Key examples:**
  - `PitchWorkflowService`: Orchestrates the full lifecycle of pitches, including creation, status transitions (approve, deny, request revisions, submit for review, cancel, complete), and validation. Coordinates with `NotificationService` for user feedback and maintains transactional integrity for all workflow steps. Handles contest, direct hire, and client management flows.
  - `PitchCompletionService`: Manages the completion process for pitches, including marking as completed, closing other pitches, updating snapshots, and triggering project completion. Ensures only eligible pitches can be completed, handles feedback/rating, and notifies all relevant parties (including clients for client management projects).
  - `NotificationService`: Centralizes notification creation, preference checks, and real-time broadcasting. Supports all major notification types (pitch status, comments, approvals, revisions, completion, client actions) and prevents duplicates. Integrates with email and WebSocket systems for multi-channel delivery.
  - `FileManagementService`: Handles secure file uploads, storage quota checks, S3 integration, and temporary download URL generation for both project and pitch files. Ensures atomic updates to storage usage and robust error handling for file operations.
- **Design notes:**
  - Services are injected into controllers and other services for maximum reusability.
  - All critical operations are wrapped in database transactions for consistency.
  - Logging and error handling are pervasive for observability and debugging.
  - Services decouple workflow/business logic from controllers and models, supporting scalability and testability.

#### Workflow Patterns
- **Pitch Lifecycle:**
  - Creation â†’ Submission â†’ Review (approve/deny/request revisions) â†’ Completion â†’ Payment
  - Each transition is validated for allowed status changes and authorized users, with events and notifications generated for every step.
  - Special handling for contests (entry, winner selection), direct hire (accept/reject offer), and client management (client approval/revisions).
- **Project Completion:**
  - When a pitch is completed, all other pitches are closed and pending snapshots are declined. The project is marked as completed, and all stakeholders are notified.
- **File Management:**
  - Files are uploaded to S3 with strict quota enforcement. Temporary download links are generated for secure access. File actions are logged and validated for permissions and workflow state.
- **Notification Delivery:**
  - Notifications are created only if user preferences allow, deduplicated within a time window, and broadcast in real-time. Email and in-app notifications are coordinated for all major workflow events.

## Observers

### Overview
Observers automate model-related side effects and synchronization, such as keeping project status in sync with pitches and triggering notifications.

### Key Observers

#### 1. `PitchObserver`
- **Purpose:**
  - Listens for pitch lifecycle events (created, updated, deleted, restored, force deleted) and synchronizes project status accordingly.
- **Key Methods:**
  - `created`, `updated`, `deleted`, `restored`, `forceDeleted`, `syncProjectStatus`.
- **Design Patterns:**
  - Encapsulates side effects and status sync logic.

#### 2. `ProjectObserver`

## Architectural Workflows & Patterns

### Pitch Lifecycle & Status Transitions
- **Pitch status transitions** are strictly validated via model methods and policies, ensuring only valid state changes (pending â†’ in_progress â†’ ready_for_review â†’ approved/denied/revisions_requested â†’ completed/closed).
- **Snapshot revision workflow** tracks every submission, request for revision, and acceptance/denial, keeping a complete revision history and status audit.
- **Pitch completion** process ensures only one pitch per project is marked as completed, automatically closing and declining pending snapshots for others.
- **Audit trail**: Every status change and significant action is logged via `PitchEvent` and surfaced in the UI via `PitchHistory`.

### Notification & Real-Time System
- **NotificationService** orchestrates all notification creation, broadcasting, and email dispatch, triggered by key user actions (submission, comment, status change, approval, denial, completion).
- **Real-time updates** are delivered via Laravel Echo, Pusher, and Reverb, with events and listeners ensuring users receive timely notifications both in-app and via email, respecting user preferences.

### Project & Pitch Observers
- **Observers** ensure project and pitch states remain synchronized, automate pitch creation for Direct Hire/Client Management, and trigger notifications/invitations as needed.

### Validation & Authorization
- **Form Requests** and **Policies** centralize validation and access control, ensuring business rules are enforced consistently across controllers and services.
