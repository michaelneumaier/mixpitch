# üéµ Standard Workflow Stripe Connect Payout Implementation Plan

## üìã Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for migrating standard workflow projects from the current direct payment system to Stripe Connect payouts, mirroring the successful contest workflow implementation.

**Current State:**
- Standard projects use direct Stripe payments (project owner ‚Üí platform)
- No automatic producer payouts
- No payout status tracking for producers
- Manual payout process required

**Target State:**
- Stripe Connect integration for automatic producer payouts
- Payout status component for producers
- Hold period and commission handling
- Unified payout experience across all workflow types

## üîç Workflow Comparison Analysis

### Standard Workflow Overview
```
1. Project Owner creates project (with budget)
2. Multiple Producers can pitch
3. Project Owner approves initial pitches
4. Producers work and submit for review
5. Project Owner can request revisions or approve
6. Project Owner marks ONE pitch as completed
7. Project Owner processes payment
8. Producer receives manual payout (current) ‚Üí AUTOMATED PAYOUT (target)
```

### Contest Workflow (Already Implemented)
```
1. Project Owner creates contest (with prizes)
2. Multiple Producers submit entries
3. Contest deadline passes
4. Project Owner selects winners
5. Winners automatically receive payouts via Stripe Connect
6. Payout status component shows real-time status
```

### Key Differences
| Aspect | Standard | Contest |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Payment Trigger** | Single completed pitch | Multiple winners |
| **Payout Recipients** | 1 producer | Multiple producers (1st, 2nd, 3rd, runner-up) |
| **Amount Source** | Project budget | Contest prize amounts |
| **Current Payout Method** | Manual | Automated (Stripe Connect) |
| **Payout Status UI** | None | Full component |

## üéØ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Verification (Week 1)
**Goal:** Confirm existing Stripe Connect infrastructure supports standard workflows

#### 1.1 Current Integration Status
Based on code analysis, the following components are **already implemented**:

**‚úÖ PitchWorkflowService.markPitchAsPaid()** - Already calls `schedulePayoutForPitch`
```php
// app/Services/PitchWorkflowService.php:798
$payoutService = app(\App\Services\PayoutProcessingService::class);
$payoutSchedule = $payoutService->schedulePayoutForPitch($pitch, $stripeInvoiceId);
```

**‚úÖ PayoutProcessingService.schedulePayoutForPitch()** - Universal pitch handling
```php
// app/Services/PayoutProcessingService.php:44
public function schedulePayoutForPitch(Pitch $pitch, string $stripeInvoiceId): PayoutSchedule
{
    $project = $pitch->project;
    $producer = $pitch->user;
    $workflowType = $project->workflow_type; // Supports 'standard'
    
    // Creates PayoutSchedule with correct workflow_type
}
```

**‚úÖ Payout Status Component** - Already included in pitch show template
```php
// resources/views/pitches/show.blade.php:235
<x-pitch.payout-status :pitch="$pitch" />
```

**‚úÖ PayoutSchedule Model** - Supports pitch_id and workflow_type fields

#### 1.2 Required Verification Tasks
- [ ] Test `schedulePayoutForPitch` with standard workflow pitch
- [ ] Verify payout status component renders for standard workflow
- [ ] Confirm commission calculations work correctly
- [ ] Test hold period calculations

### Phase 2: UI Enhancements (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Optimize payout status component for standard workflow

#### 2.1 Current Payout Status Component Analysis
**File:** `resources/views/components/pitch/payout-status.blade.php`

**Current Logic:**
```php
$payouts = \App\Models\PayoutSchedule::where('producer_user_id', $user->id)
    ->where('pitch_id', $pitch->id)
    ->with(['project', 'contestPrize'])
    ->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')
    ->get();
```

**Issues to Address:**
- Contest-specific elements (`contestPrize`) should be conditional
- Standard workflow messaging should be tailored
- Project information should be displayed for standard workflows

#### 2.2 Component Enhancement Plan
**Enhanced Standard Workflow Display:**
```php
@if($latestPayout->workflow_type === 'standard')
    <div class="col-span-2">
        <span class="text-green-600 font-medium">Project:</span>
        <div class="text-green-800 font-semibold">{{ $latestPayout->project->name }}</div>
    </div>
    <div class="text-center mb-6">
        <p class="text-green-700 font-medium">Standard Project Payout</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-green-600 mt-1">
            Payout for completed pitch work
        </p>
    </div>
@elseif($latestPayout->workflow_type === 'contest')
    <!-- Existing contest logic -->
@endif
```

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Week 2)
**Goal:** Comprehensive testing of standard workflow payout system

#### 3.1 Manual Testing Steps
```bash
# 1. Create test standard project with budget
php artisan tinker
$project = Project::factory()->create([
    'workflow_type' => 'standard',
    'budget' => 500,
    'status' => 'open'
]);

# 2. Create and complete pitch
$producer = User::factory()->create();
$pitch = Pitch::factory()->create([
    'project_id' => $project->id,
    'user_id' => $producer->id,
    'status' => 'completed',
    'payment_status' => 'paid'
]);

# 3. Test payout scheduling
$payoutService = app(\App\Services\PayoutProcessingService::class);
$payout = $payoutService->schedulePayoutForPitch($pitch, 'test_invoice_123');

# 4. Verify payout creation
echo "Payout ID: " . $payout->id;
echo "Workflow Type: " . $payout->workflow_type;
echo "Gross Amount: $" . $payout->gross_amount;
echo "Net Amount: $" . $payout->net_amount;
```

#### 3.2 Automated Test Cases
**New Test File:** `tests/Feature/StandardWorkflowPayoutTest.php`

```php
class StandardWorkflowPayoutTest extends TestCase
{
    /** @test */
    public function standard_workflow_creates_payout_schedule_when_pitch_marked_paid()
    {
        $project = Project::factory()->create([
            'workflow_type' => 'standard',
            'budget' => 500
        ]);
        
        $pitch = Pitch::factory()->create([
            'project_id' => $project->id,
            'status' => 'completed'
        ]);
        
        $pitchWorkflowService = app(PitchWorkflowService::class);
        $pitchWorkflowService->markPitchAsPaid($pitch, 'inv_test123');
        
        $this->assertDatabaseHas('payout_schedules', [
            'pitch_id' => $pitch->id,
            'workflow_type' => 'standard',
            'gross_amount' => 500
        ]);
    }
    
    /** @test */
    public function payout_status_component_displays_for_standard_workflow()
    {
        // Create paid standard pitch with payout
        // Visit pitch page as producer
        // Assert payout status component is visible
        // Assert correct messaging for standard workflow
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (Week 3)
**Goal:** Safe deployment with monitoring and rollback capability

#### 4.1 Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Verify Stripe Connect webhook endpoints are configured
- [ ] Confirm producer Stripe Connect onboarding is complete
- [ ] Test payout processing in staging environment
- [ ] Set up monitoring for payout success/failure rates
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan

#### 4.2 Monitoring & Alerting
**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- Payout schedule creation rate (should be 100% for paid standard pitches)
- Payout processing success rate (should be >99%)
- Hold period adherence (payouts should process after 3 business days)
- Component rendering success (no UI errors)

## üö® Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items

#### 1. **Existing Paid Pitches Without Payouts**
**Risk:** Standard pitches already marked as paid won't have payout schedules
**Mitigation:** 
- Create migration script to backfill payout schedules
- Test migration on staging data first
- Provide manual payout option for historical cases

#### 2. **Commission Rate Discrepancies**
**Risk:** Standard workflow commission rates might differ from contest
**Mitigation:**
- Audit commission calculations across both workflows
- Ensure consistent rate application
- Add tests to verify rate calculations

#### 3. **UI Component Conflicts**
**Risk:** Contest-specific UI elements might cause errors for standard workflow
**Mitigation:**
- Add comprehensive conditional logic
- Test component with both workflow types
- Implement graceful error handling

### Medium Risk Items

#### 1. **Hold Period Calculations**
**Risk:** Business day calculations might be inconsistent
**Mitigation:**
- Use existing contest workflow logic
- Add unit tests for edge cases (holidays, weekends)
- Monitor actual payout timing vs expected

#### 2. **Producer Stripe Connect Status**
**Risk:** Some producers might not have completed Stripe Connect onboarding
**Mitigation:**
- Check connect status before scheduling payouts
- Provide clear onboarding instructions
- Add admin tools to monitor connect status

### Low Risk Items

#### 1. **Performance Impact**
**Risk:** Additional database queries for payout data
**Mitigation:**
- Use existing query optimization techniques
- Monitor page load times
- Add database indexes if needed
