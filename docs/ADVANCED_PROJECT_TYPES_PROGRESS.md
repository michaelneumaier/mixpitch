    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Manual Intervention (Critical): Define specific scenarios (e.g., confirmed payment but order creation failed, webhook permanently failing) and provide Admins secure, logged actions to manually adjust status or link related records to resolve critical issues. Avoid overly broad "edit anything" capabilities initially.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Admin Alerting: Set up automated monitoring (e.g., using Laravel Telescope, Sentry, or custom checks) to notify Admins of critical system failures (e.g., observer errors, queue failures impacting orders, high rate of payment errors).

- [ ] ðŸ”´ **Review User Roles & Permissions:** Assess if the current Owner/Client vs. Producer structure is sufficient and scalable.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Evaluate if the simple distinction covers all necessary authorization scenarios encountered during development.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Consider potential future needs (e.g., Team accounts with shared access, Clients needing multiple logins, Admin roles with varying permissions) and determine if the current structure (e.g., basic roles, policies) would require major refactoring later. Document findings.

- [ ] ðŸ”´ **Formalize File Management Strategy:** Define and document storage, backup, security, and cleanup procedures for consistency and cost-effectiveness.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Confirm storage solution (e.g., AWS S3 bucket, local disk) and ensure consistent configuration across the app.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Define and implement a backup policy for user-uploaded files.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Implement server-side security scanning for uploads (e.g., ClamAV) to mitigate malware risks (if required by risk assessment).
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Develop a strategy/scheduled task for cleaning up orphaned/unused files (e.g., files related to deleted projects/orders, temporary uploads).
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Ensure consistent and secure access control logic for downloading files associated with `PitchFile` and `OrderFile` (using signed URLs, policy checks).

- [ ] ðŸ”´ **Consider API Strategy:** Design internal services with potential future API usage in mind, even if not building a public API immediately.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Review core services (`PitchWorkflowService`, `OrderWorkflowService`, etc.) for clear public methods, well-defined inputs/outputs, and minimal direct dependency on web-specific constructs (like full Request objects where possible). This facilitates future wrapping in API controllers.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Maintain separation of concerns (e.g., business logic in services, data transformation in resources, web handling in controllers) to simplify API development later.

- [ ] ðŸ”´ **Plan Onboarding & Feature Discovery:** Develop a strategy to introduce the new project/order types to users smoothly.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Implement UI hints (tooltips explaining types in project creation, contextual help icons linking to docs) to guide users.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Create in-app announcements (e.g., a dismissible banner) or a "What's New" section highlighting the new capabilities upon first login after launch.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Link prominently to the relevant User Documentation sections from within the interface (e.g., from project creation, dashboards).

- [ ] ðŸ”´ **Code Refinement & Consolidation:** Schedule a post-launch technical review to address tech debt and improve maintainability.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Review `PitchWorkflowService` and `OrderWorkflowService`: Identify complex conditional logic that might benefit from refactoring (e.g., using state pattern/machines, strategy pattern). Look for duplicated logic that can be extracted.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Review Policies (`PitchPolicy`, `OrderPolicy`, etc.): Ensure consistency in how checks are performed and simplify complex authorization rules if possible.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Consolidate UI components: Identify repeated Blade or Livewire structures/logic across different views (e.g., file lists, event logs) and extract them into reusable components.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Review Notification implementation: Check for consistency, potential for user preferences (channel, frequency), and use of queues for reliability.

- [ ] ðŸ”´ **Setup Monitoring & Feedback:** Implement ongoing checks and establish channels for user input to enable continuous improvement.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Implement application performance monitoring (APM - e.g., New Relic, Datadog, Telescope) covering the new controllers, services, and background jobs.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Set up robust logging and error tracking (e.g., Sentry, Flare) for new application areas.
    - [ ] ðŸ”´ Establish clear channels for collecting user feedback specifically on the new project types (e.g., feedback form, surveys, support channel analysis).
