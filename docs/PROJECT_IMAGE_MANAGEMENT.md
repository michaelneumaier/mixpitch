# Project Image Management System

## Overview
A comprehensive project image management system that allows users to easily upload, update, and remove project images directly from the Manage Project page.

## Features
- **Easy Upload**: Drag & drop or click to upload images
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic resizing and compression
- **Real-time Preview**: See image before uploading
- **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design for all devices
- **Security**: Proper authorization and file validation
- **S3 Integration**: Secure cloud storage with signed URLs

## Implementation

### Backend Components

#### 1. ProjectImageService (`app/Services/Project/ProjectImageService.php`)
Handles all image operations:
- `uploadProjectImage()` - Upload new image
- `updateProjectImage()` - Replace existing image  
- `deleteProjectImage()` - Remove image
- `validateImageFile()` - Validate uploads
- Built-in image optimization using PHP GD

#### 2. ManageProject Component Enhancement
Added methods to the Livewire component:
- `showImageUpload()` - Open modal
- `hideImageUpload()` - Close modal
- `uploadProjectImage()` - Handle upload
- `removeProjectImage()` - Handle deletion
- `updatedNewProjectImage()` - Live preview

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Image Upload Modal (`resources/views/components/project/image-upload-modal.blade.php`)
- Drag & drop interface
- Image preview functionality
- Upload progress indicators
- Error handling and validation
- Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)

#### 2. Enhanced Project Header (`resources/views/components/project/header.blade.php`)
- Upload button in manage context
- Desktop: Bottom-right floating button
- Mobile: Full-width button at bottom
- Tooltips and hover effects

## Usage

### For Project Owners
1. Navigate to Manage Project page
2. Click the camera/edit icon on the project image
3. Drag & drop or select an image file
4. Preview the image before uploading
5. Click "Upload Image" to save

### Supported Formats
- JPEG/JPG
- PNG
- GIF
- WebP

### File Limitations
- Maximum size: 5MB
- Minimum dimensions: 100x100 pixels
- Maximum dimensions: 5000x5000 pixels
- Optimized to: 1200x800 pixels (maintaining aspect ratio)

## Security Features
- Authorization checks (project ownership)
- File type validation
- File size limits
- Secure S3 storage with signed URLs
- CSRF protection

## Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly interface
- Responsive modal design
- Mobile-specific button layouts
- Optimized for iOS Safari and Android Chrome

## Error Handling
- Client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Server-side validation for security
- Graceful error messages
- Upload progress indicators
- Automatic cleanup of failed uploads

## Performance Considerations
- Image optimization reduces file sizes
- S3 storage with CDN integration
- Cached image URLs (2-hour expiration)
- Lazy loading of components
