# Contest Prize System Implementation Progress

## âœ… Phase 1: Database Foundation - COMPLETED

### Database Schema
- **âœ… Created `contest_prizes` table** with comprehensive fields:
  - `id`, `project_id`, `placement`, `prize_type`
  - Cash prize fields: `cash_amount`, `currency`
  - Other prize fields: `prize_title`, `prize_description`, `prize_value_estimate`
  - Proper indexes and constraints

### Models & Relationships
- **âœ… ContestPrize Model** with full functionality:
  - Constants for placements and prize types
  - Helper methods: `isCashPrize()`, `getDisplayValue()`, `getCashValue()`, etc.
  - Scopes for filtering by placement and type
  - Display methods with emojis and formatted names

- **âœ… Enhanced Project Model** with prize relationships:
  - `contestPrizes()` relationship
  - `getTotalPrizeBudget()`, `getTotalPrizeValue()` methods
  - `getPrizeForPlacement()`, `hasPrizes()`, `hasCashPrizes()` methods
  - `getPrizeSummary()` for display purposes

### Data Migration
- **âœ… Migrated existing contest data** from `prize_amount` to new system
- **âœ… Auto-updated project budgets** based on total cash prizes
- **âœ… Synced deadlines** from submission_deadline to deadline field

## âœ… Phase 2: Prize Configuration UI - COMPLETED

### Livewire Component
- **âœ… ContestPrizeConfigurator** component with full functionality:
  - Prize configuration for all 4 placement levels (1st, 2nd, 3rd, runner-up)
  - Support for both cash and other prize types
  - Real-time validation and field clearing
  - Auto-calculation of totals and summaries
  - Event dispatching for parent components

### Beautiful UI
- **âœ… Modern, responsive design** with:
  - Color-coded sections for different prize types
  - Interactive dropdowns and form fields
  - Real-time prize summary with totals
  - Visual feedback and validation messages
  - Professional styling with gradients and shadows

### Features Implemented
- **âœ… Multi-currency support** (USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD)
- **âœ… Prize type switching** with automatic field clearing
- **âœ… Real-time calculations** of cash totals and estimated values
- **âœ… Comprehensive validation** with custom error messages
- **âœ… Prize preview** with emojis and formatted display
- **âœ… Auto-budget updates** when prizes are saved

## ðŸ”„ Current Status

### What's Working
1. **Database layer** - Fully functional with proper relationships
2. **Model methods** - All helper functions working correctly
3. **Livewire component** - Complete prize configuration interface
4. **Data migration** - Existing contest data properly migrated
5. **UI components** - Beautiful, responsive prize configurator

### Test Results
- âœ… Database migrations successful
- âœ… Model relationships working
- âœ… Prize calculations accurate
- âœ… Livewire component functional
- âœ… UI rendering correctly

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Phase 3: Integration)

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Integrate prize configurator into project creation/edit forms**
   - Add to contest project creation workflow
   - Add to project edit pages for contest projects
   - Hide standard budget/deadline fields for contests

2. **Update project forms to use contest-specific fields**
   - Use submission_deadline instead of deadline in UI
   - Use total cash prizes instead of budget in UI
   - Conditional field display based on workflow_type

3. **Enhance contest display pages**
   - Show prizes on contest project pages
   - Display prize information to potential contestants
   - Update contest analytics to include prize data

### Future Phases
4. **Prize Distribution System** (Phase 4)
5. **Winner Notification System** (Phase 5)
6. **Prize Management Dashboard** (Phase 6)
