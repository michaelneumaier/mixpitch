- **Clear Version Tracking**: "Version 2 of 3" displayed prominently
- **Visual History**: Grid of all submissions with status badges
- **Easy Navigation**: Click any version to view its files

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### **Data Flow:**
1. Producer submits work → Creates PitchSnapshot
2. Files linked to snapshot via `snapshot_data['file_ids']`
3. Client accesses portal → Controller loads all snapshots
4. UI displays version grid → Client clicks version
5. Specific snapshot loaded → Files displayed for that version

### **Security:**
- All routes use signed URLs with 24-hour expiry
- Snapshot access validated against project ownership
- File downloads maintain existing security model

### **Performance:**
- Snapshots loaded with eager loading
- File queries optimized per snapshot
- UI progressively enhances (hides navigation for single versions)

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **Manual Testing:**
1. Create Client Management project
2. Submit initial work (creates V1)
3. Client requests revisions
4. Submit revised work (creates V2)
5. **Access Client Portal** → Should see version navigation
6. **Click V1** → Should show original files
7. **Click V2** → Should show revised files

### **Automated Testing:**
```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/ClientPortalSnapshotNavigationTest.php
```

## 🎉 Success Metrics
