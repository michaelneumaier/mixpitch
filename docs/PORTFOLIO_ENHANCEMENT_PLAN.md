## Implementation Considerations

### Database Changes
- Add new fields to the `portfolio_items` table:

  - `thumbnail_path` - For video/document previews
  - `category_id` - For categorization
  - `is_featured` - Boolean flag
  - `view_count` - For analytics

### Security Considerations
- Ensure proper file type validation for all uploads
- Implement rate limiting for uploads
- Sanitize embedded content to prevent XSS attacks
- Use pre-signed URLs for all media access
- Properly handle user-generated content in comments

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement lazy loading for all media types
- Use responsive image sizing for different devices
- Compress images before storage
- Cache commonly accessed portfolio items
- Use pagination for large portfolios

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Create database migration for new portfolio item fields
2. Implement image upload functionality with S3 integration
3. Add image display component to the profile page
4. Update the portfolio management UI to support image uploads
5. Create UI for portfolio item categories

## Success Metrics

We'll measure the success of these enhancements through:
1. Increase in producer profile completeness
2. Growth in portfolio items created per producer
3. Increase in engagement (views, interactions) on profiles
4. Reduction in bounce rate from producer profiles
5. Increase in project connections initiated from profiles
