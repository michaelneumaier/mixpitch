# MixPitch Stripe Connect Payout Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating Stripe Connect to handle payouts for both Standard Workflow and Contest Workflow project types in MixPitch. The plan addresses fee structures, **subscription-based commission collection**, contest prize distribution, cash flow implications, and technical implementation phases.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Payment Flow
1. Client creates paid project with budget (e.g., $500)
2. Producer submits winning pitch
3. Client pays via Stripe Checkout/Invoice
4. Funds collected by platform
5. **Current Gap**: No systematic payout to producer

### Existing Stripe Integration
- Using Stripe Cashier (Laravel)
- Invoice creation via `InvoiceService`
- Webhook handling (`WebhookController`)
- Connect account preparation (`stripe_account_id` field in users table)

### Discovered Subscription Tiers & Commission Rates

| User Tier | Monthly Cost | Commission Rate | Key Features |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0 | **10%** | 1 project, 3 pitches, 1GB storage |
| **Pro Artist** | $6.99 ($69/yr) | **8%** | Unlimited projects, 5GB storage |
| **Pro Engineer** | $9.99 ($99/yr) | **6%** | Unlimited projects, 10GB storage, client portal |

**Critical Finding**: Commission rates are dynamically determined by:
- **Standard & Contest Workflows**: Producer's subscription tier (who receives the payout)
- **Client Management Workflow**: Project creator's subscription tier (since client may be non-user)

### Contest Prize Structure
- **Flexible Prize System**: Each contest can have prizes for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and runner-up positions
- **Prize Types**: Cash prizes and "other" prizes (non-monetary)
- **Multiple Winners**: Contests can pay out to multiple winners simultaneously
- **Prize Tracking**: Full prize management system with `ContestPrize` model

## Enhanced Fee Structure Analysis

### Stripe Connect Fee Scenarios

For a **$500 Standard Project** with different producer subscription tiers:

| Producer Tier | Commission Rate | Stripe Fees | Platform Commission | Producer Receives | Platform Net |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Free Tier** | 10% | $14.80 | $50.00 | $435.20 | $50.00 |
| **Pro Artist** | 8% | $14.80 | $40.00 | $445.20 | $40.00 |
| **Pro Engineer** | 6% | $14.80 | $30.00 | $455.20 | $30.00 |

### Contest Prize Distribution Example

**$1,000 Contest with Multiple Prizes** (Winners with different subscription tiers):
- 1st Place: $600 (Winner: Pro Engineer = 6% commission)
- 2nd Place: $300 (Winner: Pro Artist = 8% commission)
- 3rd Place: $100 (Winner: Free Tier = 10% commission)

| Prize | Amount | Winner Tier | Stripe Fees | Commission | Winner Receives | Platform Net |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1st Place | $600 | Pro Engineer (6%) | $17.70 | $36.00 | $546.30 | $36.00 |
| 2nd Place | $300 | Pro Artist (8%) | $9.00 | $24.00 | $267.00 | $24.00 |
| 3rd Place | $100 | Free (10%) | $3.20 | $10.00 | $86.80 | $10.00 |
| **Totals** | **$1,000** | **Mixed** | **$29.90** | **$70.00** | **$900.10** | **$70.00** |

## Payment Hold Period Strategy

### Recommendation: 3-Day Hold Period

Based on research and industry standards:

1. **Immediate Processing**: Stripe processes payment to platform immediately
2. **3-Day Hold**: Platform holds funds for 3 business days after client payment
3. **Automatic Release**: Funds automatically released to producer unless dispute initiated
4. **Dispute Window**: 3 days gives reasonable time for quality concerns

### Implementation
```php
// In PayoutService
public function schedulePayoutRelease(Pitch $pitch, Carbon $releaseDate = null) {
    $releaseDate = $releaseDate ?? now()->addBusinessDays(3);
    
    PayoutSchedule::create([
        'pitch_id' => $pitch->id,
        'scheduled_release_date' => $releaseDate,
        'status' => 'scheduled'
    ]);
}
```

## Contest Prize Distribution Plan

### Multi-Winner Payout Process

1. **Contest Completion**: Project owner finalizes judging
2. **Prize Calculation**: System calculates each prize amount with appropriate commission
3. **Batch Processing**: All contest prizes processed simultaneously
4. **Individual Tracking**: Each prize distribution tracked separately

### Contest Payout Flow
```php
class ContestPayoutService {
    public function processContestPrizes(Project $project) {
        $contestResult = $project->contestResult;
        
        foreach ($project->contestPrizes as $prize) {
            if ($prize->isCashPrize() && $winner = $this->getWinnerForPrize($prize)) {
                // Use winner's subscription tier for commission rate
                $winnerCommissionRate = $winner->getPlatformCommissionRate(); // 6-10%
                $this->createPayoutForPrize($prize, $winner, $winnerCommissionRate);
            }
        }
    }
    
    private function createPayoutForPrize(ContestPrize $prize, User $winner, float $commissionRate) {
        // Create individual payout with winner's commission rate
        $commissionAmount = $prize->cash_amount * ($commissionRate / 100);
        $netAmount = $prize->cash_amount - $commissionAmount;
        
        // Process via Stripe Connect
        $this->stripeConnectService->createDestinationCharge([
            'amount' => $prize->cash_amount * 100, // Convert to cents
            'application_fee_amount' => $commissionAmount * 100,
            'destination' => $winner->stripe_account_id,
            'metadata' => [
                'contest_prize_id' => $prize->id,
                'placement' => $prize->placement,
                'commission_rate' => $commissionRate,
                'winner_subscription_tier' => $winner->subscription_tier
            ]
        ]);
    }
}
```

## Dispute Handling Strategy

### Four-Tier Dispute Resolution

#### 1. **Client-Initiated Refund Request** (0-3 days)
- Client requests refund during hold period
- Producer receives refund request notification
- Producer can approve/deny refund request
- If approved: Automatic refund processing
- If denied: Escalates to platform mediation

#### 2. **Client-Producer Resolution** (Days 3-10)
- Built-in messaging system
- Revision request workflow
- Mutual resolution tools

#### 3. **Platform Mediation** (Days 10-20)
- Admin review of deliverables
- Evidence gathering
- Mediated communication

#### 4. **External Arbitration** (Days 20+)
- Third-party arbitration service
- Binding decisions
- Fee allocation based on outcome

### Refund Request Implementation
```php
class RefundRequestService {
    const REFUND_STATUS_REQUESTED = 'requested';
    const REFUND_STATUS_APPROVED = 'approved';
    const REFUND_STATUS_DENIED = 'denied';
    const REFUND_STATUS_PROCESSED = 'processed';
    
    public function requestRefund(Pitch $pitch, string $clientEmail, string $reason) {
        // Verify refund can be requested (within hold period)
        $payoutSchedule = PayoutSchedule::where('pitch_id', $pitch->id)
            ->where('status', 'scheduled')
            ->first();
            
        if (!$payoutSchedule || $payoutSchedule->scheduled_release_date->isPast()) {
            throw new RefundException('Refund period has expired');
        }
        
        $refundRequest = RefundRequest::create([
            'pitch_id' => $pitch->id,
            'payout_schedule_id' => $payoutSchedule->id,
            'requested_by_email' => $clientEmail,
            'reason' => $reason,
            'status' => self::REFUND_STATUS_REQUESTED,
            'amount' => $pitch->payment_amount,
            'expires_at' => now()->addDays(2) // Producer has 2 days to respond
        ]);
        
        // Notify producer
        $this->notifyProducerRefundRequest($refundRequest);
        
        return $refundRequest;
    }
    
    public function approveRefund(RefundRequest $refundRequest, User $producer) {
        if ($refundRequest->status !== self::REFUND_STATUS_REQUESTED) {
            throw new RefundException('Refund request cannot be approved in current status');
        }
        
        DB::transaction(function() use ($refundRequest, $producer) {
            // Update refund request
            $refundRequest->update([
                'status' => self::REFUND_STATUS_APPROVED,
                'approved_by' => $producer->id,
                'approved_at' => now()
            ]);
            
            // Cancel scheduled payout
            $refundRequest->payoutSchedule->update(['status' => 'cancelled']);
            
            // Process refund via Stripe
            $this->processStripeRefund($refundRequest);
        });
    }
    
    public function denyRefund(RefundRequest $refundRequest, User $producer, string $reason) {
        $refundRequest->update([
            'status' => self::REFUND_STATUS_DENIED,
            'denied_by' => $producer->id,
            'denied_at' => now(),
            'denial_reason' => $reason
        ]);
        
        // Escalate to platform mediation
        $this->escalateToMediation($refundRequest);
    }
}
```

### Dispute Implementation
```php

    const DISPUTE_STATUS_OPENED = 'opened';
    const DISPUTE_STATUS_EVIDENCE_GATHERING = 'evidence_gathering';
    const DISPUTE_STATUS_PLATFORM_REVIEW = 'platform_review';
    const DISPUTE_STATUS_RESOLVED = 'resolved';
    
    public function openDispute(Pitch $pitch, User $disputeInitiator, string $reason) {
        // Freeze any scheduled payouts
        $this->freezePayouts($pitch);
        
        // Create dispute record
        $dispute = Dispute::create([
            'pitch_id' => $pitch->id,
            'initiated_by' => $disputeInitiator->id,
            'reason' => $reason,
            'status' => self::DISPUTE_STATUS_OPENED,
            'evidence_deadline' => now()->addDays(7)
        ]);
        
        // Notify all parties
        $this->notifyDisputeOpened($dispute);

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Stripe Connect Foundation (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Enhanced User Connect Setup
```php
// New database migrations
Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('connect_account_status')->default('not_created');
    $table->boolean('connect_onboarding_completed')->default(false);
    $table->boolean('payouts_enabled')->default(false);
    $table->timestamp('connect_account_created_at')->nullable();
});

// New table: payout_schedules
Schema::create('payout_schedules', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->foreignId('pitch_id')->constrained();
    $table->decimal('amount', 10, 2);
    $table->decimal('commission_rate', 4, 2);
    $table->decimal('commission_amount', 10, 2);
    $table->decimal('net_amount', 10, 2);
    $table->timestamp('scheduled_release_date');
    $table->enum('status', ['scheduled', 'processing', 'completed', 'disputed', 'cancelled']);
    $table->string('stripe_transfer_id')->nullable();
    $table->timestamps();
});
```

#### 1.2 Connect Account Service
```php
class StripeConnectService {
    public function createExpressAccount(User $user) {
        $stripe = new \Stripe\StripeClient(config('cashier.secret'));
        
        $account = $stripe->accounts->create([
            'type' => 'express',
            'country' => 'US', // Default, can be customized
            'email' => $user->email,
            'capabilities' => [
                'card_payments' => ['requested' => true],
                'transfers' => ['requested' => true],
            ],
            'metadata' => [
                'user_id' => $user->id,
                'created_via' => 'mixpitch_platform'
            ]
        ]);
        
        $user->update([
            'stripe_account_id' => $account->id,
            'connect_account_status' => 'created',
            'connect_account_created_at' => now()
        ]);
        
        return $account;
    }
    
    public function createOnboardingLink(User $user) {
        if (!$user->stripe_account_id) {
            $this->createExpressAccount($user);
        }
        
        $stripe = new \Stripe\StripeClient(config('cashier.secret'));
        
        return $stripe->accountLinks->create([
            'account' => $user->stripe_account_id,
            'refresh_url' => route('stripe.connect.refresh'),
            'return_url' => route('stripe.connect.return'),
            'type' => 'account_onboarding',
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Phase 2: Commission-Based Payout System (Week 3-4)

#### 2.1 Enhanced Transaction Model
```php
// Update Transaction model to include subscription context
protected $fillable = [
    'user_id', 'project_id', 'pitch_id',
    'amount', 'commission_rate', 'commission_amount', 'net_amount',
    'type', 'status', 'payment_method', 'external_transaction_id',
    'user_subscription_plan', 'user_subscription_tier', // Client's subscription
    'producer_user_id', 'producer_stripe_account_id', // Producer details
    'description', 'metadata', 'processed_at'
];

public static function createForPitch(Pitch $pitch, string $type = 'payment') {
    $client = $pitch->project->user;
    $producer = $pitch->user;
    
    // Determine commission rate based on workflow type
    if ($pitch->project->workflow_type === Project::WORKFLOW_TYPE_CLIENT_MANAGEMENT) {
        // Client Management: Use project creator's (producer's) subscription tier
        $commissionRate = $client->getPlatformCommissionRate();
        $commissionUser = $client;
    } else {
        // Standard & Contest: Use producer's subscription tier
        $commissionRate = $producer->getPlatformCommissionRate();
        $commissionUser = $producer;
    }
    
    return self::create([

        'net_amount' => $pitch->payment_amount * (1 - $commissionRate / 100),
        'type' => $type,
        'status' => 'pending',
        'user_subscription_plan' => $commissionUser->subscription_plan,
        'user_subscription_tier' => $commissionUser->subscription_tier,
        'producer_stripe_account_id' => $producer->stripe_account_id,
        'workflow_type' => $pitch->project->workflow_type,

### Phase 3: Dispute Management System (Week 5-6)

#### 3.1 Dispute Models and Controllers
```php
// New model: Dispute
class Dispute extends Model {
    protected $fillable = [
        'pitch_id', 'contest_prize_id', 'initiated_by', 'reason',
        'status', 'evidence_deadline', 'platform_decision',
        'resolution_amount', 'resolved_at'
    ];
    
    public function pitch() { return $this->belongsTo(Pitch::class); }
    public function contestPrize() { return $this->belongsTo(ContestPrize::class); }
    public function initiator() { return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'initiated_by'); }
    public function evidence() { return $this->hasMany(DisputeEvidence::class); }
}

// Controller for dispute management
class DisputeController extends Controller {

            ->openDispute($pitch, auth()->user(), $request->reason);

## USD-Only Implementation

**Current Scope**: All transactions processed in USD only
- Simplifies fee calculations
- Reduces currency conversion complexity
- Aligns with current system (all existing prices in USD)

**Future Considerations**: Multi-currency support can be added later by:
- Adding currency fields to payout schedules
- Implementing currency conversion rates
- Updating commission calculations for different currencies

## Key Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Subscription-Aligned Incentives**
- Higher-tier clients pay lower commissions
- Encourages subscription upgrades
- Rewards platform investment

### 2. **Contest Scalability**
- Handles multiple simultaneous winners
- Flexible prize structures
- Automated distribution

### 3. **Risk Management**
- 3-day hold period prevents fraud
- Comprehensive dispute resolution
- Automated quality gates

### 4. **Revenue Transparency**
- Clear commission structure
- Subscription-based pricing
- Predictable fee calculations

## Implementation Timeline

| Week | Phase | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1-2 | Stripe Connect Foundation | Connect accounts, onboarding |
| 3-4 | Payout System | Commission-based payouts, hold periods |
| 5-6 | Contest Distribution | Multi-prize payouts, batch processing |
| 7-8 | Dispute Management | Dispute resolution, evidence handling |
| 9-10 | Testing & Launch | End-to-end testing, production deployment |

This implementation plan provides a robust foundation for handling both standard project payouts and complex contest prize distributions while maintaining the subscription-based commission structure that drives platform revenue.
