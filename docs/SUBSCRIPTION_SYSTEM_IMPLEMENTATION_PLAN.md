# MixPitch Subscription System Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive implementation plan for subscription features in MixPitch. The plan leverages the existing Laravel Cashier integration and builds upon the current project/pitch system to create tiered subscription plans with feature restrictions for free users.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Laravel Cashier (Billable trait) already implemented in User model
- ‚úÖ Stripe integration with webhook handling
- ‚úÖ Basic billing controller and routes structure
- ‚úÖ Filament admin panel structure
- ‚úÖ Project and Pitch models with storage tracking
- ‚úÖ Role-based system (client/producer roles)

### Current Limitations
- ‚ùå No subscription plan enforcement
- ‚ùå No feature restrictions based on subscription
- ‚ùå No admin interface for managing subscription limits
- ‚ùå No subscription upgrade/downgrade flow

## Implementation Progress

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema

```sql

ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN subscription_plan VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'free';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN subscription_tier VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'basic';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN plan_started_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN monthly_pitch_count INT DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN monthly_pitch_reset_date DATE NULL;

-- Subscription limits table
CREATE TABLE subscription_limits (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    plan_name VARCHAR(50),
    plan_tier VARCHAR(50),
    max_projects_owned INT NULL, -- NULL = unlimited
    max_active_pitches INT NULL, -- NULL = unlimited
    max_monthly_pitches INT NULL, -- For Pro Engineer
    storage_per_project_mb INT DEFAULT 100,
    priority_support BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    custom_portfolio BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(plan_name, plan_tier)
);

-- Projects table additions
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN is_prioritized BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN priority_order INT NULL;
```

### Configuration

```php
// config/subscription.php
return [
    'stripe_prices' => [
        'pro_artist' => env('STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_ARTIST'),
        'pro_engineer' => env('STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_ENGINEER'),
    ],
    'plans' => [
        'free' => ['name' => 'Free', 'price' => 0],
        'pro_artist' => ['name' => 'Pro Artist', 'price' => 29],
        'pro_engineer' => ['name' => 'Pro Engineer', 'price' => 19],
    ],
];
```

### Middleware Usage

```php
// Apply to routes
Route::middleware(['auth', 'subscription:create_project'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/projects/create', [ProjectController::class, 'create']);
    Route::post('/projects', [ProjectController::class, 'store']);
});

Route::middleware(['auth', 'subscription:create_pitch'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/projects/{project}/pitches/create', [PitchController::class, 'create']);
    Route::post('/projects/{project}/pitches', [PitchController::class, 'store']);
});
```

## Next Steps

1. **Apply middleware to routes** - Protect project and pitch creation with subscription checks
2. **Create subscription views** - Build user-facing subscription management interface
3. **Implement storage enforcement** - Add file upload size checking
4. **Add upgrade prompts** - Guide users to upgrade when they hit limits
5. **Test subscription flow** - End-to-end testing of upgrade/downgrade process

## Environment Variables Required

```env
STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_ARTIST=price_1234567890
STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_ENGINEER=price_0987654321
