- **Signed URLs**: Secure client portal access from emails

### 4. **UI Components**
Created reusable Blade components:
- `resources/views/components/client-project/communication-timeline.blade.php`
- `resources/views/components/client-project/feedback-panel.blade.php`
- `resources/views/components/client-project/activity-dashboard.blade.php`

### 5. **Enhanced User Experience**

- **All Tests Passing**: ‚úÖ 5 tests, 16 assertions

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Communication Flow
1. **Producer ‚Üí Client**: Producer adds comment ‚Üí Email sent to client ‚Üí Client receives notification
2. **Client ‚Üí Producer**: Client comments via portal ‚Üí Event logged ‚Üí Producer sees in timeline
3. **System Events**: Status changes, file uploads, approvals tracked automatically

### Event Types Supported
- `producer_comment` - Producer messages to client
- `client_comment` - Client messages to producer  
- `client_revisions_requested` - Client requests changes
- `client_approved` - Client approves submission
- `submission_recalled` - Producer recalls submission
- `file_uploaded` - File activity tracking
- `status_change` - Project status updates

### Email Integration

## üìä Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized event loading with relationships
- **Pagination Ready**: Timeline component supports scrolling
- **Caching**: Leverages existing MixPitch caching strategies
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data only when needed

## üöÄ Next Steps (Future Phases)

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
