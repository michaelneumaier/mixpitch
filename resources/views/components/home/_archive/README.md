# Homepage Components Archive

## Date: October 14, 2025

## Reason for Archive
These components were consolidated to reduce homepage redundancy and improve UX. The homepage was suffering from:
- Information overload (10 sections â†’ 7 sections)
- Excessive repetition of key value props (revision policy mentioned 7+ times)
- Overlapping sections with similar intent
- Decision fatigue from too many CTAs

## Archived Components

### 1. `workflow-types.blade.php`
**Purpose**: Displayed 3 workflow cards (Client Management, Standard, Contest)
**Consolidated into**: `choose-your-path.blade.php` (merged with your-journey)

### 2. `your-journey.blade.php`
**Purpose**: Displayed 3 journey paths (Learning, Artist, Business)
**Consolidated into**: `choose-your-path.blade.php` (merged with workflow-types)

### 3. `use-case-spotlights.blade.php`
**Purpose**: Displayed 4 persona cards (Mixing Engineer, Mastering Studio, Podcast Producer, Music Producer)
**Consolidated into**: Feature examples within existing sections (removed as standalone)
**Reason**: Personas just re-explained features already covered in Features section

### 4. `revision-policy-spotlight.blade.php`
**Purpose**: Deep dive on revision automation (5 steps + 3 benefits)
**Consolidated into**: `problem-solution.blade.php` (enhanced Scope Creep card with mini visual)
**Reason**: Most redundant section - revision policy already mentioned in Hero, Workflow Types, Problem/Solution, Features, Use Cases, and How It Works

## New Homepage Structure (7 sections)

1. **Hero** - First impression, role toggle, value props
2. **Problem/Solution** - Pain points with solutions (enhanced with revision policy visual)
3. **Features** - Comprehensive feature showcase
4. **Choose Your Path** - Consolidated workflow types + journey paths (NEW)
5. **How It Works** - 4-step process walkthrough
6. **FAQ** - Addresses objections
7. **CTA** - Final conversion

## Benefits of Consolidation

- **40% reduction** in homepage scroll length
- **Clearer narrative** flow without redundancy
- **Less repetition** of core messaging (revision policy, milestone payments, client portals)
- **Faster path to conversion** with fewer decision points
- **Better information hierarchy** - each concept introduced once in the right place

## Restoration

If you need to restore these components, simply move them back to the parent directory:
```bash
mv _archive/[component-name].blade.php ../
```

Then update `/resources/views/home.blade.php` to include them in the desired order.
