### Phase 7: Addressing Verification Findings (In Progress)

*   **Refactoring (`REFACTORING_NEXT_STEPS.md`):
    *   [x] Step 1: Refactor `Pitch` Model (`app/Models/Pitch.php`) - Removed workflow/validation methods.
    *   [x] Step 2: Refactor `PitchController` (`app/Http/Controllers/PitchController.php`) - Removed workflow methods.
    *   [x] Step 3: Verify `ProjectManagementService` - Verified location and content.
    *   [x] Step 4: Review and Implement Policies (`PitchPolicy`, `PitchFilePolicy`) - Added missing `PitchPolicy::createPitch`, created and registered `PitchFilePolicy`. (Note: `ProjectPolicy` file methods pending).
    *   [x] Step 5: Review Key Livewire Components (`ManagePitch`, `UpdatePitchStatus`, `CompletePitch`) - Components generally delegate to services; `CompletePitch` method `debugComplete` looks correct.
    *   [x] Step 6: Verify Payment Processing Implementation - `InvoiceService`, `PitchWorkflowService` payment methods, `PitchPaymentController`, and `WebhookController` align with service approach.
    *   [x] Step 7: Review and Update Tests - Reviewed unit, feature, and policy tests. Identified gaps:
        *   [x] Missing unit tests for `FileManagementService::upload*`.
        *   [x] Missing feature test for successful completion in `PitchCompletionTest`.
        *   [x] Incomplete policy tests in `PitchPolicyTest` (most methods uncovered).
        *   [x] Missing `PitchFilePolicyTest` entirely.
*   **Testing (`REFACTORING_NEXT_STEPS.md` - Step 7):
    *   [x] Review tests to align with refactored code (Review complete, gaps identified above).
    *   [x] Address identified test gaps (Missing upload tests, completion test, policy tests).
